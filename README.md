# TidyTuesday

I've used RStudio on and off for a while but have never been too consistent with so for 2023 I'm committing to consistency. 
I've been impressed with the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) projects I've seen online so will be sharing the code here that I've used for the weekly challenges.
Thanks in advance to everyone on Twitter's [#RStats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/RStats) and #TidyTuesday community for support, inspiration, and for sharing your code!
